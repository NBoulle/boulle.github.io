I am currently a Research Fellow in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and will be joining Imperial College London as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Applied Mathematics in September 2024.

My research interests lie at the intersection between numerical analysis and deep learning. I primarily focus on the mathematical foundations of deep learning to discover mathematical models (partial differential equations) from data, and the development of novel and theoretically justified numerical techniques.

I am a member of the [Scientific Artificial Intelligence (SciAI) Center](https://sciaicenter.engineering.cornell.edu/) supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).
